### When I Try to Compile Angular with AoT I Get an Error

```
ERROR in Error encountered resolving symbol values statically. Calling function 'createMetaReducer', function calls are not supported. Consider replacing the function or lambda with a reference to an exported function, resolving symbol analyticsMetaReducer in ...
```

The solution is to wrap the exported meta reducer in another meta reducer that is defined as a function declaration.

```typescript
const targetMetaReducer = createMetaReducer(eventsMap, MyTarget());

export function analyticsMetaReducer(state: any, action: any) {
  return targetMetaReducer(state, action);
}
```
