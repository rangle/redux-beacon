 * Used by ReduxBeacon to generate an event for a given Redux action.

 * eventName
 * Use this property to specify the name of the event you want to emit
 * for the associated action. If not provided, the event name defaults
 * to the action type.
 *
 * eventFields
 * Attach a function to this property to define any variables you
 * would like to emit with the event. Any function assigned to this
 * property will receive the state of the application (before the
 * action), and the associated action object. Any property named
 * "event" in the returned object will override any defaults or any
 * event names defined in `eventName`.
 *
 * eventSchema
 * Use this property to define a schema for the event. Attach
 * validation functions for each property in the event that you want
 * to validate. If any of these validation functions return false,
 * ReduxBeacon will not emit the event.
